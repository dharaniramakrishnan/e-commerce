# Description
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built using React, featuring essential elements of an online store such as product listing, detailed product descriptions, and a shopping cart. It allows users to browse through items, add products to their cart, and manage their selections before proceeding to checkout. The site demonstrates clean user experience, intuitive design, and efficient state management for handling the cart functionality.
# Features:
Product Listing: Displays a variety of items with details like product name, description, price, and image.
Product Detail View: Users can click on a product to view more information about it, including a larger image and detailed specifications.
Add to Cart: Users can add items to their cart, with the cart dynamically updating as more items are added.
Cart Management:
View cart summary with all selected products.
Change the quantity of items directly in the cart.
Remove items from the cart.
Display total price and item count in the cart.
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
# Key Technologies:
React: Frontend development using React components for managing the UI and application state.
State Management: Utilizes Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks to handle product selections and updates to the cart.
CSS: Styled with custom CSS to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive design.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
